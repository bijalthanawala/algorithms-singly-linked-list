Some standard singly linked list algorithms, plus an exercise in C++.

Feel free to learn from it or verify/compare with your own. 

Open to new ideas, improvements and more link-list algorithms.


List of currently implemented algorithms:
    reverse the list recursively
    reverse the list iteratively (using stack)
    reverse the list iteratively (without using stack)
    get_nth_last item
    rotate right
