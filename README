Some standard singly linked list algorithms, plus an exercise in C++.
Feel free to learn from it or verify/compare with your own. 

Open to improvements and more link-list algorithms.


List of currently implemented algorithms:
    reverse the entire list - recursively
    reverse the entire list - iteratively (using stack)
    reverse the entire list - iteratively (without using stack)
    get_nth_last item
    rotate right
    detecting cycle/loop in the link list
